# Martian's Hands-on AppSec Training Resources


# 1. RedPlanet Appsec Range - Self-Hosted Mini AppSec Range (Docker)

A plug-and-play application security mini-range built with Docker Compose, designed for learning, teaching, and testing common web and API vulnerabilities.

## **Prerequisites**

Before running the RedPlanet AppSec Training Range, please ensure the following:

- **Docker is installed and running on your system**  
  - Verify by running:  
    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```
  - Docker Engine version 20.x or newer is recommended.

- **If Docker is not yet installed, please install it following instructions relevant to your OS:**  

  - **Windows and macOS**  
    Download and install Docker Desktop from:  
    [https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/)

  - **Convenience script works on most Linux systems**  
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sudo sh ./get-docker.sh
    ```

  - **Official Docker Hub Quickstart** guide (general overview):  
    [https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/quickstart/](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/quickstart/)

- **System resource requirements:**  
  - Minimum **4 CPU cores**  
  - At least **6 GB of available RAM**  
  - Around **15 GB free disk space** to store images and data

- **Internet connection** is required for the first run to pull the images from Docker Hub.

- **Privilege requirements:**  
  - You must be able to run Docker containers with the `--privileged` flag as the training range uses Docker-in-Docker (DinD).  
  - This typically requires administrative or root permissions on the host system.

- **Security notice:**  
  - This training range contains intentionally vulnerable applications.  
  - It is recommended to run inside isolated lab environments and never expose directly to production networks or the public internet.


### TL;DR - One-line version to pull image and start environment
```bash
sudo docker pull martiandefense/redplanet-appsec:latest && sudo docker run -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock martiandefense/redplanet-appsec:latest
```
